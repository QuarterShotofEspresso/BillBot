## What's the app & why is it important?
Every week I am afraid that I haven't paid my bills. Every week there's that one day, sometimes really early in the morning, when I wake with a start, rushing over to my laptop slurring through the same enterouage of links. Painfully darting my eyes between the hexagonal characters on my watch and the emboldened numbers under the Bill Due header. When the dates are coming close, I need to divide those ridiculous quantities by 4 and text it to all my roomates. I hate keeping up I prefer to avoid paying the bills to early, there's a golden moment which can't be . The moment just feels right. Conclusively, I'm really paranoid and equally lazy. In the eyes of my grandfather, laze is always affordable, it just depends how far you're willing to go.

Enter Billbot. This nifty, wee program address all the issues faced above. With the API accompnaying Billbot, the user can easily customize their own bot to navigate and read selectable elements of an webpage, extract the neccesary data and send a information via text to all members who reisde in the user's financial party!

## Language and additional tools
The program will be written entirely in Python3. A text messaging service and API developed by Twilio will be used in order to contact all members responsible for paying bills. Future plans include running the program in a rasberry pi to avoid having to rely on someone's personal system.

## User Input / Output
The Input Document will be a text file containing all URLs, XML elements, passwords, and usernames for each billing site. This document is customiazable and varies form website to website. An additional document will contain the numbers of all indivduals responsible for payments.
